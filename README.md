internship task-4 at the Prodigy InfoTech.


- '**Implement a Sudoku Solver**'
- Create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers. It should use backtracking or other suitable techniques to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers for the puzzle. Once solved, the program should display the completed Sudoku grid.


  **Overview**
- This project is a Sudoku Solver application developed in Python, designed to automatically solve Sudoku puzzles. The application uses a backtracking algorithm to find solutions and features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to input unsolved puzzles and visualize the solutions.


**Features**

  - **User-Friendly Interface:**
    - Developed using Tkinter to provide an intuitive and visually appealing GUI.
    - Users can easily interact with the application to manage their contacts.
      
  - Algorithmic Solver:
    - Utilizes a backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles.
    - Capable of handling various difficulty levels and edge cases.
  
  - Input Validation and Error Handling:
    - Validates user inputs to ensure accuracy and completeness of contact details.
    - Provides informative feedback for invalid inputs and operations to enhance user experience.


**Technologies Used**
  - Python:
    - Core programming language used for the algorithm and application logic.
  - Tkinter:
    - Python's standard GUI toolkit used to create the user interface

**How to Use**

  1. Clone the Repository:
  ```html
git clone https://github.com/utsavvachhani/sudoku-solver.git
cd sudoku-solver

  ```
  2. Run the Application:
  ```html
python sudoku_solver.py

  ```
  3. Use the Interface:
     - Input a Puzzle: Enter the Sudoku puzzle into the provided grid.
     - Solve the Puzzle: Click the "Solve" button to find and display the solution.
     - Clear the Grid: Click the "Clear" button to reset the grid and input a new puzzle.

**Example Usage**
- When the user starts the application, they can input an unsolved Sudoku puzzle into the grid. By clicking the "Solve" button, the application will solve the puzzle using the backtracking algorithm and display the completed grid. The user can then clear the grid to input a new puzzle.

**Project Structure**
```html

    sudoku_solver.py
    README.md
```

**Future Enhancements**
- Add functionality to generate Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.
- Improve the GUI with more interactive elements and enhanced aesthetics.
- Implement additional solving techniques for faster and more efficient solutions.
